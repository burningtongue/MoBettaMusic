Also the holy trinity is supposed to be iggy bowie lou, but got switched i think with punk 77. classic rock shoyuld feature lots of them stones animals, mc5, kinks, chocolate watchband yardbirds stuff and solar sailor for the thematic trent Reznor Daft Punk, Muse kind of stuff oh and cowpunk is my first when I was on a crazy Mike Ness phase. Outlaws ,Steel Guitars Mosh Pits with some Dylan and Waylon for fun yeah johnny too and Hank the III. \r\n#\r\nSkip the alternative ones they like the genre are just latte sippin' leftie emo posers with their druggie lovers lament drivel still listening to the smiths while waiting for their video on Mtv and tattoing radiohead lyrics on their eyelids on repeat. bored with it since 2005 punk is dead and nirvana was totally overrated in retrospect.\r\n#\r\nhave fun, and if you find any Neil go buy the flacs or DSD or DVD Audio and crank it the only way thats respectable, hint its never internet radio.\r\n\r\n :) \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
